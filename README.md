## Video Game Buddy

Objective: Have you ever played THE PERFECT game, sunk countless hours into it, only to have it end, which forces you to stare into the void of what to do with your free time now that your favorite story is over?... well we have! Videogame Buddy would like to hear about your favorite video games, and see if they can offer you some new games to play that are similar!

Problems we ran in to
Git hub and size limits . our original data files were too large for git hub. we had to run this code: git lfs install . Eventually we were able to add the files to repo. Then we recieved and email regarding size limits. We settled with hosting the original files on an aws account and we have a link to it. We orignally had  cleaned 2 sets of data, the games and the reviews. we decided to we only needed the one data csv ( games). and we deleted the other file for space reasons.
